The AB test shows that the drease in gross conversion is both statistically and practically significant; Net Conversion does not show a significant difference. Thus, we see less students enrolled in the free trail without a significant decrease in the number of students who ended up purchasing the course. The goal is then achieved by the change, and I would recommend to launch the change. "
